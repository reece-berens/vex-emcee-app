API project structure

Local API - used for local development and testing
Lambdas - code that's uploaded to lambdas for running the API code
	hopefully this allows session cookie stuff... otherwise ben will have to do some funky stuff



RE.API - classes/objects used to call the RE API
RE.Objects - object library for API data
VEXEmcee.Objects - object library for internal objects and API request/response objects
VEXEmcee.DB.Common - interfaces/etc. for the methods that will interact with database and data storage
VEXEmcee.DB.Dynamo - AWS DynamoDB implementation of VEXEmcee.DB.Common interface
VEXEmcee.DB.SQLLite - SQLLite implementation of VEXEmcee.DB.Common interface (not high priority, something for the future if people want to run this locally)
VEXEmcee.Logic - all logic needed for running API methods, performing background tasks, etc.
